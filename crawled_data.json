The Fitness team have built this along side the Fitness advisory panel in the aim to help assist members towards their working potential when lifting. The Guide is based off the Brzycki Formula which is built around 1RM into %. \nIt should be noted that as a trainer, you can use this guide as a tool to open conversation up around what a member will be trying to lift on the day. As well as a tool to help prescribe members with weights to lifting on their working sets. \nEXAMPLE ONE: \nFORMAT: Tuesday LIFT, Deadlift focus session,  Heavy 5 reps. \n\"Go find your last 3RM or what you think you can achieve for 3 reps for Deadlifts. If you can hit \n130kg\n for 3 reps you should be aiming for \n120kg \nfor 5reps.\"\n3RM: 130\n5REP: 120\n10REP: 100\nEXAMPLE TWO: \nFORMAT: Friday LIFT, Front Squat session, working to 8 reps. \n\"Look at the Lifting Guide and see what you've hit for 3 or 5 reps then work your way back to find a weight between the 5 rep and 10 rep weights. If you can hit \n75kg\n for 5 reps, you'll want to aim for between your 5 rep and 10 rep weight. I'd suggest working towards \n67.5-\n70kg \nfor 8 as a top set\"\n3RM: 80kg\n5REP: 75kg\n10REP: 65kg\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLIFTING GUIDE IMPORTANT NOTES\n \n \n \nPlease note that the lifting guide is to be printed and put in location.

(RIR)\n \n \n \nReps in reserve is a trainer tool utilised to help members lift to the prescribed intention. The Fitness team use this as a method to measure the intensity of a lift by describing how many more reps a member could do before \ntechnical failure\n. Technical failure is used to describe when a member can no longer perform a rep \nSAFELY with proper technique\n. \nIt's important to note that the reason we have moved away from % of 3RM and leant into RIR is for member experience and ease of session delivery. As we are all aware, we train the every day athlete (Fitstoppers). Expecting them to feel amazing and at their peak performance consistently is not achievable. RIR is a more effective way to communicate to a broad group of people at any level of fitness. This also allows a new member to understand the intention of the session without understanding what their 3RM. is. \nWHAT DOES RIR LOOK LIK EIN PROGRAMMING AND HOW DO I TALK ABOUT IT TO MEMBERS?\nRIR will start to be included in our next 12 week block starting April 10th.\nEXAMPLE\nLIFT SESSION 9-18-8\nS2&4) \nX8-6-\n6-4-4\n \n(RIR: 0-1) \nDEADLIFT\nX15+ BANDED PULL APART \n(optional)\nREST\nTRAINER EXPLANATION. \n\"During todays Deadlifts you'll be progressively adding more load on the bar as the reps go down, Your top sets should feel like you have 1 rep in reserve. Meaning when you finish the set you should feel like you only have 1 rep in reserve.\"\nEXAMPLE\nPERFORM SESSION 6 X 6\nS2) ALT. EMOM\nX5 FRONT SQUAT\n (RIR: 4) \nINTO MAX WALL BALLS  \nTRAINER EXPLANATION.\n\"Today at station 2 we have an alternation EMOM with your partner. When you pick the weight for Front Squat you want to think of a weight you can still manage to complete about 4 more reps.  So we are not working to a maximum weight, think challenging but maintainable.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMark as Complete\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n×\n \nTopic Pending Approval\n \n \n \n \nThis topic is pending approval by the course owner.
